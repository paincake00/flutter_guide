**shared_preferences** is a Flutter plugin that allows you to save data in a key-value format so you can easily retrieve it later.

The **shared_preferences** library uses the system’s API’s to store data into a file. 

These are small bits of information like integers, strings or Booleans. It has three main sets of function calls: 
1. setXXX: Set methods save the data of that specific data type. 
2. getXXX: Get methods retrieve the data of that specific data type. 
3. clear(): This method deletes all saved data. 
4. remove(): This method removes a specific value.

All of these methods except the clear() method use a key to access an item. By giving the library a unique key, you can store, retrieve and delete specific items. 
Here’s an example: 
```dart
final CURRENT_USER_KEY = 'CURRENT_USER_KEY'; 
final sharedPrefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance(); 

sharedPrefs.setString(CURRENT_USER_KEY, '1011442433'); 
... 
sharedPrefs.remove(CURRENT_USER_KEY);
```
